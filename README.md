## How it works

Gather username, password, and follower/hashtag to target
    *if no follower/hashtag is provided insta.py will target at random
Utilize Selenium to open instagram.com and log into account
Start following followers of the target account or hashtag
Each account followed is moved into a list
Once completed...print the number of accounts followed
After 24 hours pull list of own followers and compare two lists to see who followed back and who didn't
Remove everyone followed or only remove people who didn't follow back?
Provide the user with number of followers gained in the 24 hour period
    *maybe we don't need to wait 24 hours?
Have random sleep times to prevent being deteced as a bot
