## How it works

1.)Gather username, password, and follower/hashtag to target<br/>
  1.)if no follower/hashtag is provided insta.py will target at random*<br/>
2.)Utilize Selenium to open instagram.com and log into account<br/>
3.)Start following followers of the target account or hashtag<br/>
4.)Each account followed is moved into a list<br/>
5.)Once completed...print the number of accounts followed<br/>
6.)After 24 hours pull list of own followers and compare two lists to see who followed back and who didn't<br/>
7.)Remove everyone followed or only remove people who didn't follow back?<br/>
8.)Provide the user with number of followers gained in the 24 hour period<br/>
  8.)*maybe we don't need to wait 24 hours?*
9.)Have random sleep times to prevent being deteced as a bot<br/>
